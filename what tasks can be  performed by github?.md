# Tasks can be performed by github.

## GitHub offers a wide range of tasks and features that facilitate software development, collaboration, and project management. Here are some tasks that can be performed using GitHub.
### We can also use github other than these tasks that I mentioned. Due its wide range of offers.

*   1. Version Control:
####        Create repositories to manage your codebase and track changes over time.
####        Commit changes to your code and provide descriptive commit messages.
####        Create and manage branches for different features, bug fixes, or experiments.

*   2. Collaboration:
####        Invite collaborators to work on your repositories.
####        Review and comment on code changes made by collaborators.
####        Merge code changes from different branches using pull requests.
####        Resolve conflicts that arise when merging code changes.

*   3. Code Review:
####        Review code changes in pull requests and leave comments for feedback.
####        Approve or request changes to code before merging pull requests.

*   4. Issue Tracking:
####        Create and manage issues to track bugs, feature requests, tasks, and more.
####        Assign issues to collaborators and set labels and milestones.
####        Discuss and provide updates on issues using comments.

*   5. Project Management:
####        Use GitHub Projects to create boards for managing tasks, features, and sprints.
####        Visualize and organize work using columns, cards, and automation.
####        Move issues and pull requests across boards as they progress.

*   6. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):
####        Integrate with CI/CD tools like GitHub Actions or third-party services.
####        Automate testing, building, and deploying code changes.
####        Set up workflows that trigger on specific events, such as push or pull request creation.

*   7. Code Quality and Security:
####        Use code scanning to identify vulnerabilities and code quality issues.
####        Receive alerts and recommendations for improving code security.

*   8. Documentation:
####        Create README files to provide information about your project, installation instructions, and usage guidelines.
####        Add documentation to your codebase using Markdown or other formats.

*   9. Wikis:
####        Create and maintain project documentation, guides, and FAQs using GitHub's built-in wikis.

*   10. GitHub Pages:
####        Host a static website for your project directly from your GitHub repository using GitHub Pages.

*   11. Licensing and Copyright:
####        Add a license file to your repository to specify how others can use your code.
####        Include copyright and licensing information in your codebase.

*   12. Forking and Contributing to Open Source:
####        Fork repositories to create your own copy and propose changes to the original project.
####        Contribute to open-source projects by submitting pull requests with your code changes.

*   13. Community Engagement:
####        Interact with other developers by commenting on issues, pull requests, and discussions.
####        Participate in GitHub Discussions to have broader conversations about the project.

*   12. Analytics and Insights:
####        Access insights into repository activity, traffic, and usage.
####        Gain visibility into the impact of your code changes and contributions.

*   14. GitHub API and Integrations:
####        Build integrations and applications that interact with GitHub using its API.
####        Develop custom tools, automation, and analytics solutions for your projects.

##### These are just a few examples of the many tasks that can be performed using GitHub. The platform is designed to support various aspects of the software development lifecycle and collaboration among developers and teams.
