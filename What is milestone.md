# What is milestone and how it is created?

### In GitHub, a milestone is a way to organize and track a set of issues and pull requests (PRs) together as a group. It's a project management feature that helps teams plan and manage their work by grouping related tasks, features, or bug fixes under a specific goal or timeframe. Milestones provide a way to set targets, track progress, and plan releases within a GitHub repository.

## Here's how milestones work in GitHub:

* 1.    Goal-Oriented Grouping:
####        A milestone represents a specific goal, task, or objective that you want to achieve within a project. It could be a feature release, a bug-fixing cycle, a sprint, or any other significant milestone in the development process.

* 2.    Issues and Pull Requests Association:
####       You can associate issues and PRs with a specific milestone. This helps organize tasks and features that are related to the goal represented by that milestone.

* 3.    Tracking Progress:
####        Milestones provide a visual way to track the progress of tasks. When you view a milestone, you can see the list of associated issues and PRs, their current status, and any related discussions.

* 4.    Assigning Due Dates:
####        You can assign due dates to milestones to indicate when you intend to complete the associated work. This helps set expectations for the team and stakeholders.

* 5.    Categorization and Prioritization:
####        Milestones allow you to categorize and prioritize work. You can use them to group tasks that need to be completed together, making it easier to plan and manage your project.

* 6.    Release Planning:
####        For software projects, milestones often correspond to release cycles. You can plan which issues and PRs should be completed for a particular release and use the milestone as a reference point for your development and testing efforts.

* 7.    Overview and Reporting:
####        Milestones provide an overview of the progress of your project. You can see the number of open and closed issues and PRs, making it easier to gauge how well the project is progressing.

* 8.    Closure and Review:
####        When all the associated issues and PRs are completed, you can close the milestone. This signifies that the goal represented by the milestone has been achieved. It's also a good time to review the work done and plan for the next steps.

##      To create a milestone in GitHub:

##### Milestones are a valuable tool for project planning, tracking, and organization within GitHub repositories. They help teams stay focused on goals, collaborate effectively, and manage the development process more efficiently.
