# How to create Issue in github?

## Creating an issue in GitHub is a simple process that allows you to report, track, and discuss tasks, bugs, feature requests, and other project-related topics. 
### Here's a step-by-step guide on how to create an issue in a GitHub repository:

* 1.    Navigate to the Repository:
####        Open your web browser and go to the GitHub website.
####        Sign in to your GitHub account if you haven't already.
####        Navigate to the repository where you want to create an issue.

* 2.   Go to the "Issues" Section:
####       Once you're in the repository, click on the "Issues" tab near the top of the page. This will take you to the issues section of the repository.

* 3.    Create a New Issue:
####        On the issues page, click the green "New issue" button. This will open the issue creation page.

* 4.    Provide Issue Details:
####        In the issue creation page, you'll see fields where you can provide information about the issue:
####            Title: Enter a concise and descriptive title for the issue.
####            Comment: Write a detailed description of the issue. Include relevant information such as steps to reproduce, expected behavior, and any error messages.
####            Labels: Optionally, you can assign labels to categorize the issue (e.g., bug, enhancement, question).
####            Assignees: If you want to assign the issue to a specific user, you can do so here.
####            Milestone: Associate the issue with a specific milestone if applicable.
####            Project: Link the issue to a project board if you're using GitHub Projects.
####            Linked pull request: If the issue is related to a pull request, you can link it here.

* 5.    Preview and Submit:
####       After providing all the necessary information, review your issue to ensure accuracy.
####        Click the green "Submit new issue" button to create the issue.

* 6.    Discuss and Collaborate:
####        Once the issue is created, a discussion thread will be generated. You and other collaborators can comment on the issue to discuss the details, propose solutions, and share insights.

* 7.    Additional Actions:
####        You can further customize the issue by adding comments, mentioning other users using "@" symbols, attaching files, or referencing other issues or pull requests.

* 8.    Notifications:
####        Users who are assigned to the issue or who participate in the discussion will receive notifications when there are updates or comments.

* 9.    Closing the Issue:
####        Once the issue is resolved, it can be closed by the person who created it or by someone with the necessary permissions. Closed issues remain accessible for reference but are marked as resolved.

##### Remember that the specific appearance and features on GitHub may vary based on updates and changes to the platform. The steps outlined above are based on the general process for creating issues as of last knowledge update in September 2021.
